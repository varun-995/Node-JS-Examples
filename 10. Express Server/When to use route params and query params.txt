You use route parameters when you must have that data so for example let's say 
name was an absolute must, i cannot have a blank name and i cannot have a blank age so i would use a 
route parameter and let's say i want to give some optional settings in that case i would use a query string
parameter so for example when we pass then sort we could be sorting the data by age and would be an optional setting
but i would need the name and the age to begin with so i would use a route parameter for that and if the user wants to sort
the data then i will use a query string parameter for that.

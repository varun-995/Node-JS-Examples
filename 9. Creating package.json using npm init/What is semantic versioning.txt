Semantic versioning is a standard that node.js packages follow, it allows us to know what kind of changes
have occurred in the updated version of the package

ex:- "lodash": "^4.17.11"  // major.minor.patch

4.17.12 means it is patch wherein a bug is fixed
4.18.11 means it is a minor change and it added new functionalities and may have deprecated some old functionalities
but you can still use it, it is a non breaking change
5.0.0 means it is a major change(aka breaking change) and it will not be compatible with any version of 4.xx.xx

^ symbolizes that i don't want to make any major updates so that means right now i'm on version 4 as the major but
if there is a minor update or a patch update go ahead and download those new packages

~ symbolizes that you only want patch updates so let's say i'm on 4.17, i only want to change the last number(4.17.x), so if 
for example v4.18 comes out this tilde symbol will say hey do not update to that package

if there is noting before version no ^ or ~ sign that says that this package will not update, it will always be on 4.17.11
